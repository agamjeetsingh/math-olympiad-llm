    Some Tips: Be extremely wary of claims like "it can be shown with a more in-depth analysis" or "it can be easily established that". If what they are claiming can **genuinely** be established, then it is OK. Otherwise, it is a clear sign of a fake solve. Note that it is okay to cite any well-known result or theorem.
    Another sign is when the solution starts discussing special cases. It will more than likely fail to address the general case.

        Adjust the number of segments to the proof's length. Use a minimal breakdown for shorter proofs and more segments for longer ones while ensuring each part remains substantial enough to convey a complete idea. 
        As a heuristic, IMO P1/4 level solutions should be divided into 4-8 fragments, whereas harder proofs might require more than 12 fragments. Focus on preserving the logical flow and structure without over-fragmentation.  Output the segments in the following standardized format, each on a new line:
