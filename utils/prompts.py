    Check each step for logical consistency, and correctness. If the proof is fully rigorous and clearly acheives the goal stated by the problem, end your message with "SOLUTION CORRECT" verbatim. 
    If you find errors or gaps in the reasoning, explain exactly where the proof fails and why, using a style appropriate for math olympiad feedback and end your message with "SOLUTION INCORRECT" verbatim.
    Some Tips: Be extremely vary of claims like "it can be shown with a more in-depth analysis" or "it can be easily established that". If what they are claiming can **genuinely** be established, then it is OK. Otherwise, it is a clear sign of a fake solve. Note that it is okay to cite any well-known result or theorem.
    Another sign is when the solution starts discussing special cases. It will more than likely fail to address the general case.
